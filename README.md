# Use polynomial fitting to reconstruct missing areas in a point cloud face with coding assistance from ChatGPT

## About "polynomial fitting"
Please refer to this link for how to build a formula from points:
https://www.scilab.org/surface-fitting
<br>
Or we can observe how the  surface fitting works with an app:
https://www.originlab.com/fileExchange/details.aspx?fid=282

Typically, a smooth surface can be described using a polynomial formula:

The common applications of polynomial techniques include: 
  
* Noise Reduction: Fit a polynomial to noisy data and use it as a smoothed representation.
  
* Interpolation: Estimate values at unknown points within the domain of the data.
  
* Surface Approximation: Model complex surfaces like terrain, curved structures, or fluid flow.

* Feature Extraction: Analyze curvature or other geometric properties of the surface.

In this test, we aim to retrieve the missing points from the point cloud face stored in a CSV file.


## 1) About the test: 
We designed a 3D face and generated a "point set A" from it, with some points in the central area intentionally missing.

"point set B" was created similarly, but with random positioning errors added in the x, y, and z directions, ranging from ±0.1 to ±0.3.

This is the original surface:

Points set A, point set B (noise added), and target point set after fitting.

## 2) How ChatGPT can help in coding: 
The advice from ZD.net for the advantages and disadvantages of coding with ChatGPT :

Now we try to ask ChatGPT: "*Apply a polynomial algorithm to generate a 3D face from the current pt_cloud which is provided in a CSV format.*"

Then we can receive the reply on the PC screen: 

To apply a polynomial algorithm to generate a 3D face from a point cloud provided in a CSV format, we can follow these steps:


1. Load the Point Cloud: 
    * Read the CSV file containing the point cloud data. Ensure the file has x, y, and z coordinates for each point.

2. Fit a Polynomial Surface:

   *  Use polynomial fitting to approximate the surface. For 3D point clouds, we typically fit a 2D polynomial to model 
z=f(x,y).
   *  Choose the degree of the polynomial based on the complexity of the surface.

3. Generate the Surface:
   * Use the fitted polynomial coefficients to create a smooth surface grid over the range of the 
x and y coordinates.

4. Export the Result:

   * Save the generated 3D surface points (x, y, z) into a new CSV file.

You can test or modify the code as needed; the file Polynomial_fit.py contains the complete implementation.


## 3) Check result
3.1) Fitting the original point cloud (point set A), 9-degree fitting takes 17 seconds.

The distance from the missing pt to the ori face is 0.117 mm.
  
3.2) Fitting points cloud with noisy (point set B), 9-degree fitting also.

The maximum distance from the regenerated missing pt to the ori face is 0.122 mm.

## 4) The limitations of polynomial fitting: 
* Overfitting: High-degree polynomials can fit noise instead of the actual data.
* Oscillations: Higher degrees can cause wavy curves, especially at the edges.
* Data Issues: Sparse or uneven data can lead to poor fits.
* Complexity: High-degree fitting takes more time and effort.
* Poor Extrapolation: It doesn’t work well outside the data range.
* Sensitive to Outliers: Small changes in data can affect the entire curve.
* Limited for Complex Shapes: One polynomial may not fit surfaces with varying curves.
